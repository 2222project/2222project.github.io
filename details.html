        <h4>1.5% per year</h4>
        <p>We plan to distribute around 1.5% of assets per year.  Our simulations show that 
        cumulative distributions over the first 50 years will be maximized by picking a
        distribution rate between 1.5% and 6%.  But <i>after</i> the first 50 years, lower
        distribution rates do dramatically better.</p>

        <p>1.5% is just a target.  If the endowment grows more slowly than expected then we will
        reduce distributions to as low as 0.5%.  And after we reach our goal we will increase
        distributions, to 5% or more.  These adjustments help us meet our goals even if the market
        performs badly.</p>

        <h4>200 years</h4>
        <p>A time horizon of 200 years enables contributions to go much further.  Here is our
        estimate of the impact of $100 over time.</p>

        <h4>5% annual growth</h4>
        <p>Equities have historically grown at about 6.8% per year (after inflation and including dividends)<a 
        class="cite" href="http://www.moneychimp.com/features/market_cagr.htm">*</a>.
        Actual annual returns vary dramatically, but the <i>distribution</i> of annual returns has
        been stable over the past 150 years.  We feel it's reasonable to expect that distribution
        to persist far into the future.</p>

        <p>After subtracting 1.5% for annual distributions and another 0.1% for overhead, just over
        5% per year remains.  We reinvest that into the endowment, to drive growth.</p>

    <h1 class="title">Reaching everyone</h1>

    <div class="row">

      <section class="one-third column">
        <h4>100 million people</h4>
        <p>Currently in the US, adults over the age of 18 living in poverty make up about 10% of
        the population, or around 32 million people<a 
        class="cite" href="https://www.census.gov/library/publications/2015/demo/p60-252.html">*</a>.
        By the year 2222, based on US census projections<a
        class="cite" href="http://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2014/cb14-tps86.html">*</a>,
        we expect that the overall population will have tripled to about 1 billion people. So we
        need to plan for supporting 100 million people.</p>

        <p>We exclude children in order to avoid incentivizing parents to have more children
        in order to receive more money.  And we focus on individuals rather than households in
        order to avoid incentivizing any particular family structure.</p> 
      </section>

      <section class="one-third column">
        <h4>$12,000 per person</h4>
        <p>The goal is to be able to pay adults a basic income of $12,000 per year.
        That's about the same as the US federal poverty level for individuals<a
        class="cite" href="https://www.healthcare.gov/glossary/federal-poverty-level-FPL/">*</a>,
        slightly more than the poverty gap for households living in poverty<a
        class="cite" href="http://federalsafetynet.com/us-poverty-gap.html">*</a>,
        and roughly the average income of the bottom quintile of households<a 
        class="cite" href="http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/statistics/household-income-quintiles">*</a>.</p>

        <p>For the first few decades we will distribute smaller amounts per person, down to as
        little as $100.  This allows us to reach more people, and lets us perform rigorous studies
        of the impact of our cash transfers.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="one-third column">
        <h4>$1 billion to start</h4>
        <p>A $10 investment today will likely be able to support one person in the year 2222.
        To support 100 million people we therefore need about $1 billion.</p>

        <p>That investment will grow, and within 200 years should enable distributions of $1.2
        trillion per year, paid from an endowent with assets of up to $50 trillion.  For comparison,
        $1.2 trillion is more than three times total charitable giving in the US<a
        class="cite" href="http://www.nptrust.org/philanthropic-resources/charitable-giving-statistics/">*</a>,
        and $50 trillion is twice the current value of the entire US stock market.
        Fortunately the economy will also grow<a
        class="cite" href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/GDPC1">*</a>, so $50 trillion
        will likely amount to less than one percent of the market.</p>
