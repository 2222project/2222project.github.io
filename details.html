        <h4>1.5% per year</h4>
        <p>We plan to distribute around 1.5% of assets per year.  Our <a href="simulate.html">simulations</a>
        show that we can maximize cumulative distributions over the first 50 years by picking any
        distribution rate between 1.5% and 6%.  But <i>after</i> the first 50 years, lower
        distribution rates do dramatically better.</p>

        <p>1.5% is just a target.  If the endowment grows more slowly than expected then we will
        reduce distributions to as low as 0.5%.  And after we reach our goal we will increase
        distributions, to 6% or more.  These adjustments help us meet our goals even if the market
        performs badly.</p>

        <h4>5% annual growth</h4>
        <p>Equities have historically grown at about 6.8% per year after inflation and including dividends
        [<a class="cite" href="http://www.moneychimp.com/features/market_cagr.htm">1</a>].
        Actual annual returns vary dramatically, but the <i>distribution</i> of annual returns has
        been stable over the past 150 years, therefore it's reasonable to expect that distribution
        to persist far into the future.</p>

        <p>After subtracting 1.5% for annual distributions and another 0.1% for overhead, just over
        5% per year remains.  We reinvest that into the endowment, to drive growth.  A 5% annual
        growth rate means assets and distributions should both double every 14 years or so.</p>

    <h1 class="title">Reaching everyone</h1>

    <div class="row">

      <section class="one-half column">
        <h4>100 million people</h4>
        <p>Currently in the US, adults over the age of 18 living in poverty make up about 10% of
        the population, or around 32 million people
        [<a class="cite" href="https://www.census.gov/library/publications/2015/demo/p60-252.html">1</a>].
        By the year 2222, based on US census projections we expect that the overall population will
        have tripled to about 1 billion people
        [<a class="cite" href="http://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2014/cb14-tps86.html">2</a>].
        So we need to plan for 100 million people living in poverty in the future.</p>

        <p>We focus on adults over 18 and on individuals rather than households, in order to avoid
        incentivizing any particular family structure.</p> 
      </section>

      <section class="one-half column">
        <h4>$12,000 per person</h4>
        <p>The goal is to be able to pay adults a basic income of $12,000 per year.
        That's about the same as the US federal poverty level for individuals
        [<a class="cite" href="https://www.healthcare.gov/glossary/federal-poverty-level-FPL/">1</a>],
        slightly more than the poverty gap for households living in poverty
        [<a class="cite" href="http://federalsafetynet.com/us-poverty-gap.html">2</a>],
        and roughly the average income of the bottom quintile of households
        [<a class="cite" href="http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/statistics/household-income-quintiles">3</a>].</p>

        <p>For the first few decades we may distribute smaller amounts per person, down to as
        little as $100.  This will allow us to reach more people, and study the impact of different
        sizes of transfers.</p>
      </section>

    </div>

    <div class="row">

      <section class="one-half column">
        <h4>$1 per person to start</h4>
        <p>A $10 investment today will likely be able to support one person in the year 2222.
        To eliminate poverty in 10% of the population, we therefore need about $1 per person, or
        about $1 billion in seed capital.  If we raise more then we can solve poverty sooner;
        if we raise less then it will take longer.  Either way, the impact per $1 invested will
        be the same.</p>

      </section>

      <section class="one-half column">
        <h4>2% of the market</h4>
        <p>A $1 billion investment should grow enough over 200 years to enable distributions of
        $1.2 trillion per year, paid from an endowent with assets of $25 trillion.  For
        comparison, $1.2 trillion is more than three times total charitable giving in the US
        [<a class="cite" href="http://www.nptrust.org/philanthropic-resources/charitable-giving-statistics/">1</a>],
        and $25 trillion is the current value of the entire US stock market.  Fortunately the
        economy also grows.  If GDP continues to grow at a relatively conservative 2% over inflation
        [<a class="cite" href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/GDPC1">2</a>], we will own 
        roughly 2% of the total stock market.</p>
