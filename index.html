        <h4>What We Do</h4>
        <p>We are creating an endowment to give cash directly to people who need it, with no strings
        attached.  Donors can focus their contributions on their particular community.  Donors can
        also contribute on behalf of their school, company, congregation, or other group.</p>

        <h4>Who We Are</h4>
        <p>The 2222 Project was founded in 2016 by Kim Burchett.  Kim is a senior engineering manager
        at Google, a former managing director at Goldman Sachs, and a mother living in Brooklyn.
        She's currently putting together a strong board of directors to run the project.</p>

        <p>We will begin accepting donations in late summer
        of 2016, once our nonprofit registration is complete.  Please 
        <a href="http://twitter.com/2222project">follow us on twitter</a> for updates.  In the meantime,
        if you'd like to
        <a href="mailto:volunteer@2222project.org">volunteer</a> to help us get started, we'd love to
        have you.</p>

        <h4>How It Works</h4>
        <p>Our approach is based on two powerful techniques: exponential growth and cash transfers.</p>

        <p><b>Exponential growth</b>.  All our contributions go to fund an endowment that targets 5%
        annual growth after inflation, with 1.5% per year in distrubutions.  That means our impact will
        start out small, but should double every 14 years or so.  We expect that a one-time contribution
        of $100 today will enable us to award a total of $300 within 50 years, $5,000 within 100, and 
        almost $3 million by 2222.  Exponential growth is the fuel that makes it feasible to actually
        end poverty within just a few generations.</p>

        <p><b>Cash transfers</b>.  Several studies have proven that direct cash transfers are effective
        at reducing poverty
        [<a class="cite" href="http://www.mdrc.org/news/press-release/new-findings-show-new-york-city%E2%80%99s-conditional-cash-transfer-initiative-reduced">1</a>,
        <a class="cite" href="http://www.cashlearning.org/english/home">2</a>,
        <a class="cite" href="https://www.givedirectly.org/research-at-give-directly">3</a>].
        Cash enables recipients to buy what they need most, whether that means paying rent, buying food,
        repairing their car, or even starting a small business.  Cash transfers also require very
        little overhead relative to the value provided.  That allows the vast majority of funds to go
        directly to the people who need it.  We will partner with universities to conduct randomized
        controlled trials to measure the impact of our approach.</p>
