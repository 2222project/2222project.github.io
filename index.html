        <h4>What We Do</h4>
        <p>We are creating an endowment to give cash directly to people who need it, with no strings
        attached.  Donors can focus their contributions on their particular community.  Donors can
        also contribute on behalf of their school, employer, congregation, or other group.</p>

        <h4>Who We Are</h4>
        <p>The 2222 Project was founded in 2016 by 
        <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kimberley-burchett-961125">Kim Burchett</a>.
        She is currently putting together a strong board of directors to guide the project.</p>

        <p>We expect to begin accepting donations in fall of 2016.  Please 
        <a href="http://twitter.com/2222project">follow us on twitter</a> for updates.  In the meantime,
        if you'd like to
        <a href="mailto:volunteer@2222project.org">volunteer</a> to help us get started, we'd love to
        have you.</p>

        <h4>How It Works</h4>
        <p>Our approach is based on two powerful techniques: exponential growth and cash transfers.</p>

        <p><b>Exponential growth</b>.  A significant fraction of contributions will go into an endowment
        that targets 5% annual growth.  That enables our impact to double every 14 years or so.  We
        expect that $100 added to the endowment today will result in total gifts of $300 over 50 years,
        $5,000 within 100 years, and over $1.5 million by 2222 (all numbers are inflation adjusted).
        Exponential growth is the fuel that makes it feasible to actually end poverty within just a
        few generations.</p>

        <p><b>Cash transfers</b>.  Several studies have proven that direct cash transfers are effective
        at reducing poverty
        [<a class="cite" href="http://www.mdrc.org/news/press-release/new-findings-show-new-york-city%E2%80%99s-conditional-cash-transfer-initiative-reduced">1</a>,
        <a class="cite" href="http://www.cashlearning.org/english/home">2</a>,
        <a class="cite" href="https://www.givedirectly.org/research-at-give-directly">3</a>].
        Cash enables recipients to buy what they need most, whether that means paying rent, buying food,
        repairing their car, or even starting a small business.  Cash transfers also require very
        little overhead relative to the value provided.  That allows the vast majority of funds to go
        directly to the people who need it.  We will partner with universities to conduct randomized
        controlled trials to measure the impact of our approach.</p>
